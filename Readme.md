It is required to design a module for displaying requests for transportation

- create an arbitrary set of orders and loading / unloading points;
- on the left of the screen there should be a table with a list of orders, and on the right a map;
- active order should be highlighted;
- and the map will display the loading and unloading points of the application in the form of markers and a polyline;
- polyline is built from an arbitrary service for building tracks along roads;
- loading / unloading points of applications in the table must be editable (in the form of a select from the directory of points);
- the border between the table and the map must be changeable with the mouse (moves left and right);
- the table should be able to scroll horizontally;
- to display the map, it is desirable to use the Leaflet package, for components - AntdDesign, for storing the state of components and data - Redux, for reacting to events - Saga;
- don't use classes, only functional components;
